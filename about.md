# Authority

**Authority** comes from intersubjective agreement.

- Be a lamp unto your self.
	> You can write your own code, or you can copy mine. Use Git.
- **Ethics**, **Authority**, and **Agreements**.
	> This is just a template for starting to think about inter-subjective framing on a system of legal **Version Control**. 
	What other issues must be discussed?

# Agreements

So far we have no agreements.

> In the future there will be a link here to propositions.
## Propositions

More on that later.

## Amendments

Right now everyone should keep their own Git. 
No need for formal Amendments until there is a formal repository of agreements.

> **Note:** The **Future** has not been published yet.
## Hierarchy

Until there is a formal repo there needs to be no hierarchy.

> **Incorporate** the **Best Ideas** from **Anyone** </br>
> *"Best" is a Subjective Evaluation*.

## Democracy and Liberty

Sometimes we have to do things we would rather not do because it seems to be in our vital self interest. When this is the case we firmly believe in `Due Process`
For example:

|    |Problem            |Process      |
|----|-----------------|---------------|
|Taxes | Consent to be ruled     |`Accountability`  |
|Inequality | Fortune is provisional and idiosyncratic.    |`Democratic Social Wellfare`   |
|Restorative Justice  |   |` `|



## Git Up for Version Control


```mermaid

Daniel ->> Rick: Prop. 1138?
Rick->>John: What do you think John?
Rick->> Daniel: How about these changes?
Daniel->> Rick: Great suggestions!
Rick->> John: I am going with this for now!
John->> Rick: Looks good to me too.
Daniel-->John: Agree to Prop 138v2 
Note right of John: Prop1138 <br/>So Complex<br/>Many people prefer <br/>the similar Prop108
```

### We don't have to agree on everything:
